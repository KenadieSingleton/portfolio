<h2> Likes & Dislikes</h2>
  <p> I thoroughly enjoy video games, cartoons, and webcomics, as well as anime.<br>
    My favorite games are Pokemon, Story of Seasons, and Rythym games in general.<br>
    My favorite cartoons are The Powerpuff Girls and Johny Bravo, <br>
    and my favorite animes are JoJo's Bizzare Adventure and
    Revolutionary Girl Utena.<br>
    Lastly, my favorite webcomics are The Bittersweet Candy Bowl, Socializing 101, <br>
    Long Exposure, Love! Love! Fighting!, and Avialae, just to name a few.<br>
    These games, shows and comics have really influenced me in my art and story telling stye, <br>
    and my decision to pursue art more seriously.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
    There aren't many things I dislike.</p>
